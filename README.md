# Introduction

This is the first of the 30 [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/settings) projects required to earn the Full Stack developer certification.i

It is the first of the 5 Responsive Web Design Projects.

I actually did a version of this project for the legacy curriculum with [MagiKarp](https://codepen.io/kiwisquash/full/QOBrJN). 

Since I am starting over, I decided to create a brand new page, featuring one of my favorite YouTuber: TechLead.
