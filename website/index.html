			<h2>Who is the TechLead?</h2>
			<p>The TechLead (aka Patrick Shyu) is an ex-Google Tech Lead, a software engineer, an app entrepeneur and a YouTube celebrity. He appears to have a god-like coding abilities, making him a legend of sorts. He has also has a number of apps, which has generated a lot of revenue. I don't know much about his work as a software engineer, but I am a big fan of his videos. He seems to be good friends with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV0qA-eDDICsRR9rPcnG7tw">Joma</a>, another YouTuber I like.</p>

			<h2>What does he do?</h2>
			<p>The TechLead videos which are both entertaining and educational. His videos often contain very good life tips and career advices. As a fun-employeed math person trying to break into the word of software engineering, I found his messages very inspiring.</p>

			<h2>Why a Tribute?</h2>
			<p>After getting laid off from a company where I worked for over 3 years, I felt very lost and confused about what I wanted to do with my life. I suppose I could have always crawled back to academia, become an Lyft driver, or a bartista at Peet's. His videos helped me find a sense of direction, a vision of who I want to be in 10 years.</p>
